"""Curated labels: a curator's names for concepts, applied at export (PRD P12.12).

Extraction names a concept after what stores it: ``cust_nm`` becomes ``custNm``.
A curator — working in ``arango-ontoextract``'s lexicon, or from a customer's
business glossary — decides it is really ``customerName``. That decision has to
survive regeneration, so it cannot live in r2g's output (regenerated on every
export) nor in AOE's extracted ontology (rewritten on every extraction). It lives
in a **curated-labels document** that r2g reads when it exports, and both
exporters apply it the same way.

The document::

    {
      "curatedLabelsVersion": "1",
      "producer": "arango-ontoextract",          # optional, recorded
      "ontology": "crm",                          # optional, recorded
      "entities":      [{"name": "Account", "label": "Customer", ...}],
      "properties":    [{"entity": "Account", "name": "custNm",
                         "label": "Customer Name", ...}],
      "relationships": [{"name": "placedBy", "label": "placed by", ...}]
    }

Every entry may also carry ``description``, ``altLabels`` (synonyms),
``decidedBy`` and ``decidedAt``.

**Keys are the names r2g generates.** ``name`` (and ``entity``) are r2g's own
conceptual names before any renaming: ``owl_entity_name(target_collection)``,
``owl_property_name(stored field)``, ``owl_property_name(edge collection)``. A
CSI document exported with ``--label-policy warn`` (or ``off``) carries exactly
these names, so an ontology imported from it into AOE exports keys that match.
A key that matches nothing is reported ``unmatched``, never silently dropped.

**``label`` is the curator's words; the identifier is derived.** ``"Customer
Name"`` becomes ``customerName`` for a property or relationship and
``CustomerName`` for an entity (CC-12), because the name is an IRI local name a
query is written against. The words themselves are kept as ``prefLabel``, and
the generated name joins ``altLabels`` so a question that uses it still resolves.

**One decision, two exporters.** :func:`plan_curated_labels` decides every
rename and every refusal. ``mapping_to_csi`` and ``mapping_to_r2rml`` both build
the plan from the same mapping through :func:`r2g.csi.curated_plan_for_mapping`,
so the SQL leg and the graph leg can never disagree about a concept's name —
contextual-data-fabric refuses to build a catalog whose CSI names a property the
R2RML does not map.

**A rename is refused rather than traded for a new defect.** Applied before the
P12.1 label-collision check, a curated name must not:

- rename a declared cross-source join key (P6.7) — ``conceptualModel.joinKeys``
  and the bind-join both reference the bare label;
- take a property or relationship name any other property or relationship
  already holds, on any entity — the P12.1 invariant that no label is carried
  by two entities is the reason curation exists;
- take another entity's name.

A refused entry keeps its generated name and is recorded ``refused`` with the
reason; refusing one rename can free or occupy a name another entry wanted, so
refusal is repeated until nothing changes.
